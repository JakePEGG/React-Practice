Name a Component Class
Good! Subclassing React.Component is the way to declare a new component class.

When you declare a new component class, you need to give that component class a name. On line 4, notice that our component class's name is MyComponentClass.

Component class variable names must begin with capital letters!

In addition, there is a React-specific reason why component class names must always be capitalised. We'll get to that soon!

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component{}
