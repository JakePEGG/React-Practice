### Intro to JSX ###

Hello World
Take a look at the following line of code:

const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
What kind of weird hybrid code is that? Is it JavaScript? HTML? Or something else?

It seems like it must be JavaScript, since it starts with const and ends with ;. If you tried to run that in an HTML file, it wouldn't work.

However, the code also contains <h1>Hello world</h1>, which looks exactly like HTML. That part wouldn't work if you tried to run it in a JavaScript file.

What's going on?

The Mystery, Revealed Good!

Take another look at the line of code that you wrote.

Does this code belong in a JavaScript file, an HTML file, or somewhere else?

The answer is...a JavaScript file! Despite what it looks like, your code doesn't actually contain any HTML at all.

The part that looks like HTML, <h1>Hello world</h1>, is something called JSX.


--------------

What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.

What does "syntax extension" mean?

In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can't read it!

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

JSX Elements
A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.

Here's an example of a JSX element:

<h1>Hello world</h1>
This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.

Instructions
1.
In app.js, write a JSX <p></p> element containing the text, Hello world. Use the example code above as a guide.


SOLUTION:
<p> Hello World </p>

------------------

JSX Elements And Their Surroundings
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array...you name it.

Here's an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
Here's an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};
Instructions
1.
Create a JSX <article></article> element. Save it in a variable named myArticle.


SOLUTION:

const myArticle = <article></article>

-----------------

JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:

my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"
Here are some JSX elements with attributes:

<a href="http://www.example.com">Welcome to the Web</a>;

A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

const panda = <img src="images/panda.jpg" alt="panda" width="500px" height="500px" />;
Instructions
1.
Declare a constant named p1.

Set p1 equal to a JSX <p></p> element. Write the word foo in between the <p></p> tags.

2.
On the next line, declare a constant named p2.

Set p2 equal to another JSX <p></p> element. Write the word bar in between the <p></p> tags.

3.
Give the first <p></p> an id attribute of "large".

Give the second <p></p> an id attribute of "small".

SOLUTION:
const p1 = <p id="large">foo</p>;
const p2 = <p id="small">bar</p>;

----------------
Nested JSX
You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.

Here's an example of a JSX <h1> element, nested inside of a JSX <a> element:

<a href="https://www.example.com"><h1>Click me!</h1></a>
To make this more readable, you can use HTML-style line breaks and indentation:

<a href="https://www.example.com">
  <h1>
    Click me!
  </h1>
</a>
If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses. This looks strange at first, but you get used to it:

(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>
      Click me!
    </h1>
  </a>
)
Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions, etc., just like non-nested JSX expressions can! Here's an example of a nested JSX expression being saved as a variable:

 const theExample = (
   <a href="https://www.example.com">
     <h1>
       Click me!
     </h1>
   </a>
 );
Instructions
1.
Declare a new variable named myDiv. Set myDiv equal to a JSX <div></div> element.

Wrap the <div></div> in parentheses, and use indentation and line breaks like in the examples. In between the <div></div> tags, nest an <h1></h1> containing the text Hello world.

SOLUTION:
